NPO Name: Amanzimtoti

<strong>Introduction</strong>

Based on our previous meeting we had with you about your water and sanitation company, we have come up with an easy efficient way of representing your information on the site. We plan to create a site that will be integrated with a mobile application that will give members of the NPO and general public better access to information on your projects. <br />
