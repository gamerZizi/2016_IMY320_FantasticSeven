IMY 320 Website Project Proposal
NPO Name: 

Introduction

Based on our previous meeting we had with you about your water and sanitation company, we have come up with an easy efficient way of representing your information on the site. We plan to create a site that will be integrated with a mobile application that will give members of the NPO and general public better access to information on your projects. 

Background
Sanitation is a basic human need that most rural communities do not have access to. Since established in 2010, NPO Name has been involved in projects that enrich human lives by providing awareness about water conservation and the maintenance of hygienic conditions. 

Communities without proper sanitation suffer from major diseases and pollution but thanks to your organisation, people’s lives have improved immensely from a number of your projects.
